# Client Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze client data and generate an **Insight Card** that provides a clear and interpretable summary of model predictions.  
The card presents key information such as client details, model prediction, probability, and interpretability insights (using SHAP values).  
This helps stakeholders and decision-makers quickly understand the impact of features and potential business actions.

## 📊 Data
- The dataset includes both **numerical** and **categorical** features.  
- Preprocessing steps applied:
  - **Encoding** categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.  
  - **Scaling** numerical variables using StandardScaler.  
  - **Balancing** imbalanced data with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

## 🤖 Models Used
We trained and compared multiple models to predict client outcomes:

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Simple linear model  
   - Good for interpretability  

2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
   - Ensemble of decision trees  
   - Handles non-linearity and feature interactions well  

3. **XGBoost Classifier**  
   - Gradient boosting algorithm  
   - Highly accurate, often best performing  

Each model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score.

## 🔍 Interpretability with SHAP
To make predictions transparent, we used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
- Identified **top contributing features** for each prediction.  
- Displayed **positive and negative feature impacts** on model output.  
- Helped explain **why** a client was classified as high-risk or low-risk.

## 📈 Findings
- **XGBoost** outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and robustness.  
- Key features influencing predictions were:
  - Income Level  
  - Age  
  - Credit Score  
  - Loan History  
- The **Insight Card** summarizes client-level predictions in a **tabular, business-friendly format**.  
- This allows teams to quickly interpret results and decide next steps.
